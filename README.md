## Description
Having trouble keeping tracks of what books you have your eyes set on? Have trouble no longer! Book search is a simple program that is connected to the google books API database that allows you to search up books and save them. Additionally, you are able to look up additional books with our handy dandy search function. Google books also provide short descriptions for books if you are indecisive in your reading journey.
